  {
    "letter": "א",
    "question": "Is a llama kosher?",
    "answer": "Why do you ask? Are you planning to eat Madame Llama? Because if so, we have bigger theological problems than dietary laws."
  },
  {
    "letter": "ב",
    "question": "Is Sansa just a dog?",
    "answer": "No. She's the unofficial CEO, spiritual muse, and occasional nap consultant."
  },
  {
    "letter": "ג",
    "question": "What does Rotterdam have to do with Boston?",
    "answer": "About 5,000 lines of code, shared Google Docs, and some videos of Sansa ignoring us."
  },
  {
    "letter": "ד",
    "question": "Did a stuffed animal actually come up with this idea?",
    "answer": "Yes. Madame Llama whispered, “Start the Sansa Foundation.” We listened. You should too — she’s terrifyingly wise."
  },
  {
    "letter": "ה",
    "question": "Are there really six languages?",
    "answer": "Yes. One for each way Miriam and Rene understand the world: through myths, mysticism, eyeliner, hobbits, unresolved childhood emotions — and the one they use to talk to 'normal' people."
  },
  {
    "letter": "ו",
    "question": "Why do you take stories so seriously?",
    "answer": "Because stories built the world. Also because we’re Jewish and arguing with stories is our cardio."
  },
  {
    "letter": "ז",
    "question": "Can I donate Sephora points to the cause?",
    "answer": "Emotionally? Yes. Logistically? We haven’t figured out the halachic ruling on that yet."
  },
  {
    "letter": "ח",
    "question": "Will this project make me cry?",
    "answer": "Probably. But like, in a good, cathartic, “I just remembered who I am” kind of way. And we have tissues."
  },
  {
    "letter": "ט",
    "question": "Is there a plan, or are you winging this?",
    "answer": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "letter": "י",
    "question": "Does Madame Llama have voting rights?",
    "answer": "She has veto power. Which is worse."
  },
  {
    "letter": "כ",
    "question": "What’s the official halacha on digital folk tales?",
    "answer": "Somewhere between Pirkei Avot and fan art. We’re still investigating."
  },
  {
    "letter": "ל",
    "question": "Why does this feel like a fever dream and a thesis defense at once?",
    "answer": "Because it is. And also because you're paying attention."
  },
  {
    "letter": "מ",
    "question": "Will this help me understand my family?",
    "answer": "No. But it might help you forgive them. Or at least re-cast them."
  },
  {
    "letter": "נ",
    "question": "What if I don’t understand any of the languages?",
    "answer": "That’s okay. Sometimes the language understands you first."
  },
  {
    "letter": "ס",
    "question": "What does Sansa think of all this?",
    "answer": "She's still waiting for royalties. But she approves of the poetic license."
  },
  {
    "letter": "ע",
    "question": "Are hobbits canon here?",
    "answer": "Yes. Especially the ones who read footnotes."
  },
  {
    "letter": "פ",
    "question": "Is this a cult?",
    "answer": "No, but we do have a shared Google Calendar and a lot of candlelight."
  },
  {
    "letter": "צ",
    "question": "Are you okay?",
    "answer": "Define “okay.”"
  },
  {
    "letter": "ק",
    "question": "Will Rene always be this intense?",
    "answer": "Only on days that end in “y.” But don’t worry, he comes with snacks and edits."
  },
  {
    "letter": "ר",
    "question": "What happens when Rene goes quiet?",
    "answer": "It usually means he’s writing something dangerous. Or figuring out the perfect song lyric to say what he can’t."
  },
  {
    "letter": "ש",
    "question": "Does Rene ever stop thinking in metaphors?",
    "answer": "No. It’s how Rene finds shape in things that would otherwise stay silent."
  },
  {
    "letter": "ת",
    "question": "What exactly did Madame Llama say to Rene?",
    "answer": "“Your name is carved into this story. So go make it worth reading.”"
