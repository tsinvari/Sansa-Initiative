      "question": "What is The Sansa Initiative?",
      "answer": "The Sansa Initiative is a digital exploration into interconnected knowledge across various traditions and philosophies. It aims to reveal underlying truths through diverse thematic lenses."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I navigate the different themes?",
      "answer": "Each theme, such as Pragmatic, Talmudic, Lorderian, Zoharian, Sephorian, and Experimental, offers a unique perspective. You can switch between them using the language selector in the header."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the cards and how do they work?",
      "answer": "The cards represent concepts or ideas within each theme. Clicking on a card's front side will reveal more information on its back. Some cards may require validation before revealing deeper content."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do some cards require validation?",
      "answer": "Certain profound concepts (often cards 5, 6, 7) are designed to be explored after you've reflected on the foundational ideas presented in the earlier cards (1-4). This encourages a more thoughtful and mindful progression."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the 'Lorderian' movement type?",
      "answer": "The Lorderian animation symbolizes the ephemeral and transient nature of reality and knowledge. Cards appear and disappear randomly, representing the constant flux of information and insights in the universe."
    },
